# House Keeping
- Something something research to consumers
- Lectures and evaluation sessions?
- something compare 2 algorithms? then what we do some research on it?

# Introduction
- The meliorist Model - situation > do something > conclude and answer to it 

# Computing Project types
#### 1. Research-based
- Research paper are just people sit around, and talk shit about each other? (wtf?)
- Compare the work in between the research? 

#### 2. Development
- building a software or program in general 

#### 3. Evaluation
- evaluate application, configurations, software
- includes case studies for evaluation 

#### 4. Industry-based
- solving a problem in an organization

#### 5. Problem solving
- forming new techniques to solve a problem
- or using existing solutions and apply it to another field/domain

# Originality
- use different patterns
- explore unknown areas, come up with something and solve it (ultimate boredom)


# Research Process
1. Sequential
	1. simplist of all
	2. approach plan find results
	3. may change the nature of the research 
2. Generalized
	1. Similar to sequential process 
	2. defines the steps of what to do 
	3. does not mean all step needs to be taken 
3. Circulatory
	1. Continuous cycle of discovery and investigation
	2. Allows the research process to join at any-point 
	3. never ending cycle
4. Evolutionary
	1. one step further than circulatory

# Intellectual discovery
#### Deductive Reasoning
- build you model based off your observation
- compare to other model, other models use existing knowledge
- from deductive reasoning we make an assumption
- based on the observation of the world

#### Inductive Reasoning
- Interpretation of the world
- from the subject or problem you are studying 
- from something you know and believe already
