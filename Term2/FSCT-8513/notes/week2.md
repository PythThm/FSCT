#### Prefetch
- prefetch files: show how many times a program is executed 
- we cannot claim the user execute those files, be careful with our wordings
- we can parse it into our forensics too

#### Very important tool in FTK to cut processing time 
- **Filter Manager**
- only jpg files? > include type of filters >without jpg? > Exclude
