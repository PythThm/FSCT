# DIGITAL FORENSICS 
#### Introduction
- when analyzing evidence, search for everything 
- data recovery, registry, web, emails, everything you can collect as data 
- input fed into the analysis tool > tool processes input > tool creates outputs > we interpret that output
- even with the most advanced tools will not produce 100% accurate output
- The goal of the user is to use the tool to the best of it capabilities, analysis the output and write the final reports 
- Similar to using an AI tool, it does not replace our work but to act as a tool to assist us 

#### FTK - Forensic Tool Kit
- comes in different functions, Imager, Password recovery tool kit for brute-forcing
- We can share the case with multiple users and groups
- Create user > Set details > Assign roles 
- we can setup and interface for non-technical user (Case Reviewer)
- The case folder will contain the results 
- Compound files = archives (Zip, all LE file "word file")
- **TIME ZONE IS SUPER IMPORTANT**

#### Proper way to Exit FTK 
- file > close > save case > backup 
- Database > log out > exit
