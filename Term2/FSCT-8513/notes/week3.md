# Filter
- Define new filter > extension > file type (.jpg, .xls)
- ignore secondary Duplicated files > define > Search for duplicate > "is" "Secondary" > exclude
	- why? because including not secondary duplicated files will only show primary 
	- as it will filter out all non-duplicated files as well
	- so exclude it 
- why use filter instead of overview "file extension"
	- it might include all kinds of other files that FTK might define as the same file
	- example he used is graphics
	- but "file types" shows the same number as the filtered results (idk)
- **Best practice is to use filter to find the files you need**

# Bookmarks
- you can go to bookmarks and make an empty bookmark 
- or select "checked" files and add them to bookmark
- when adding multiple files to a bookmark, remember to select "all checked"
- create/add to bookmark options, 
- you can 

# Index
- literally just type in the keyword
- its fast query as it is indexed already 

# Report
- Files > report
- We basically only need case information and Bookmarks
- In case information, make sure to uncheck fields that you don't have any input
- in Bookmarks, we always check ***"Export files & include links"***
- for emails, select ***"include email attachments***
	- go to export options > check the **"link to exported email attachments"** 
	- reason is to skip duplicated items that are already included
- pictures, you can include thumbnails for easier and user friendly view of them
- Columns
	- For regular files, Report - Standard is fine
	- For emails, email template
	- For pictures, use graphics (photo is also an option)
- ***"Apply these settings to children"*** will remove all setting you have for individual bookmarks
- Formats: PDF & HTML is the basics
- Time zone is important

# Some good feature to remember
- the select icons on the file tab 
- remember to clear all selected before adding new evidence to a bookmark 
- in "overview", the arrows on the right of the "+" sign selects all the files under that
