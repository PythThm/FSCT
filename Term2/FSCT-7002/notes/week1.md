#### Rule of Law (Turriff speech)
- Introduction of the Canadian Constitution act we start with "rule of law"
- 7 fundamental principles shall be maintained 
	- Law should be the product of what majority of us concludes, reflect the consensus of the Canadian citizens
	- the government should work towards the change of the society
	- No one gets a pass, everyone is subjects to the law in the same way
	- public consensus may apply for exception for this ^ 
	- have to make decision based on the evidence on that case, be independently partial 
	- have the ability to speak to your lawyer privately to get the best assistant 
	- gives people a way to order their lives 
- Rules of Law lays foundation of everyone should be treated equally 
- Courts are applying and interpreting the law
- inquisitorial vs adversarial system
	- Adversarial favours the rights and freedom of an individual 
	- the judge would advice what to do and actively participates in the system
	- in inquisitorial it would be fairness, where judges acts as a referee
