#### Why do we care about evidence
- we piece the puzzle together to picture, the puzzle being the evidence for the case, final picture as in the trial
- we don't rely information that's not reliable or trustworthy 
- **actus reus (the guilty act) and mens rea (the guilty mind).**
- Actus reus refers to the physical, prohibited action, inaction, or circumstance. Mens rea refers to the mental intent, knowledge, or recklessness behind that act
- the crown has to prove illegal acts happens at the same time with a guilty mind 

# Cross examination
#### Direct examination
- proving or disproving in our case 
- point is to test that evidence, if the evidence or witness is reliable 
- is there impairment, memory overflow 
- getting evidence from the examination, see if you can get more information from testing it 
- Defence doing cross examination in a necessary 
- you don't have to point to any evidence, but can relate to them
- Judge just listens in, and see if they need to call hearsay, whether evidence is admissable
- we can only see if witness is truthful through cross examination but it may not be reliable
- how we can see the evidence to be is through cross examination

#### R. v. Lyttle, 2004 SCC 5
- where's the evidence for doing drugs yo
- cross examination to push back crown's case 
- we get the evidence through the question we ask in cross examination
- its not about gut hunches
- if you don't allow cross examine without interfere then its not respecting the right of the accused (Charter rights)
- ***“A good faith basis” is a function of the information available to the cross-examiner, his or her belief in its likely accuracy, and the purpose for which it is used
	- Dishonest is a bad faith basis, like leading the case framing the accused
	- agenda question in favour to your client (defence)
	- whats the goal, theory that you are to prove 
	- proving a hypothesis 
	- not evidence based, but good faith  
- asking witness is a good faith basis in this case 
- Don't ask question recklessly 
- This case is to say the judge should not interfere with cross examination to preserve the right of the innocent not to be convicted 

#### R. v. Kehler, 2004 SCC 11
- trier of law vs trier of fact 
- what laws to apply, judge's duty
- instruct juries what the law is, this is the common law, statue law, defence here, now go apply them 
- judge will force ^ on themselves if Jury is not present
- Did the judge apply the principle? (in this case)
- he found the right law, instructed himself with it with *Vetrovec*
- But they don't have to apply Vetrovec in every case, but in this case it is needed
- *Disreputable witness*
	- sketchy ahh witness, be cautious of the evidence from this fucker 
	- recognized that and give yourself a warning  
- ***Where a particular risk attaches to one critical element of that evidence, the trier of fact must be satisfied that the witness’s potentially unreliable evidence can be relied upon as truthful in that regard.

#### Relevance vs materiality 
- is the evidence logical connected - Relevance
- raining case? umbrella make sense 
- materiality legally connected 
- if the umbrella is wet? material - to prove there's water falling from the sky 

#### Weight and Probative value 
- effectively the same thing 
- does this add anything to this case 
- misuse of the evidence to basis one sides' case? 
- Probative is to see how good an evidence is to prove 
- Evidence of criminal record is extremely prejudice, low probative, basis the case 
- Probative would be "in this case did they commit this criminal right now"
- Crown cannot lead the case with criminal record because of this ^ 
> ***It has been recognized since Lord Herschell L.C.’s time that it is one thing to talk about so general a test as balancing probative value against prejudice, and a different and much more difficult thing to apply the test in a practical way. What are the manageable criteria?  How “probative” must the evidence be to get over the admissibility hurdle?  How much prejudice is too much?  How do we calibrate the scales that balance probative value against prejudice
> The policy basis for the exclusion is that while in some cases propensity inferred from similar facts may be relevant, it may also capture the attention of the trier of fact to an unwarranted degree.  Its potential for prejudice, distraction and time consumption is very great and these disadvantages will almost always outweigh its probative value. - R. v. Handy, 2002 SCC 56 

# Who can call evidence
- the accused does not have to give evidence 
- cook's case, are they obligated legal to call victim complainant 

#### [_**R. v. Cook**_ 1997 CanLII 392](https://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/1997/1997canlii392/1997canlii392.html?resultId=b643b181a6164ffa8a709390e910a3d4&searchId=2026-01-23T10:14:03:754/5cd94589df23492ba11f77ba8cc6788a)
- you don't necessary have to call victim complainant
- rule of evidence crown does not have to call the victim complainant 
- The crown is required to push the evidence to its maximum strength 
- ***Part of this discretion involves the choice of which witnesses to call.  Given the strong preference this Court has shown for deferring to the Crown’s discretionary authority, it would take a strong opposing rationale to warrant the creation of a duty which so clearly impedes it.
- ***Crown’s not calling witnesses would cause a trial by ambush,
- ***These developments have extinguished any rationale compelling the Crown to call witnesses based on the need to bring all material facts forward.
- ***A failure on the Crown’s part to call a witness which would result in prejudice to the accused because of loss of the choice to address the jury last should not affect the Crown’s discretion to produce the witnesses it chooses.

#### s.650
- s.650.3 protects the accused to make a defence
- sub 1 says the accused has to be present during the trial 
- sub 1.1 says if the party and judge agrees then accused is allowed to appear in the trial, but not if evidence of a witness is taken
- sub 2 allows other execptions 
	1. sub a: get the guy out of the court cuz they are interrupting
	2. sub b
		1. this seems to contradict with sub 1
		2. use this to move forward in the case if the accused just runs away during trial 
	3. sub c: mental condition of the accused, adverse effect on the mental condiction

# Eyewitness Misidentification

- double conviction 
- example of the eyewitness misidentification
