# Testify
- Law Society of BC Code of Professional Conduct rules 5.3 & 5.4
- charter section 14 protected rights, translator for your trail
#### Communication with witnesses giving evidence - 5.4
- witnesses can speak to whoever they want, unless it is a civil case
- nobody on the crown side have a lawyer 
- if you want to speak to a victim complaint you can do so 
- you have to let the lawyers to their job, no "OBJECTION!"
- you cannot be obstructive, if based on rule of evidence then you can ask questions - 5.4.1
- section 5.4.2
	- during breaks, examining lawyer can discuss with the witness 
	- but during cross-examination of the lawyer's own witness, they cannot discuss with the witness
	- so under cross examination, no talking to them about their evidence (with anyone)
	- think about whats the meaning of cross examination, we don't want someone to be hanged up during the proceeding, cuz they will give evidence artificially and its not good for the truth
	- your statement from police is not evidence
- police officer needs to provide all the things they have done in an investigation
- they sit down and write the "Will Say", they come to court and tell their disclosure
- sometimes crown don't want to call the police, then they would use the "Will Say" in place of an officer 
- they still need to take the oath? 

#### What is and is not evidence
- when there is a questions about an evidence, judge - trier of fact judges the admissibility of that evidence
- often when there are no jury, the judge would be more lenient, opposite to when there's jury
- if one party challenges, often Voir Deir, rarely you deal with it on the point
- Voir Deir
	- the accused brings up charter rights violation
	- "the trial inside a trial"
	- if the evidence is denied, we just forget everything about that 

# Types of evidence
 **2 main types of evidence are direct and circumstantial**
## Direct Evidence
- trying to prove or disprove evidence
- direct experience to prove what that witness is called to prove 
- example: Accused murder someone, if witness say if they are in the room with accused and he saw this guy kill another guy, this is direct experience and direct evidence
- they saw the thing that was trying to be prove
- there are no blanks needs to be filled for their evidence 
- Rest upon the credibility of the witness 
## Circumstantial
- where the witness did not directly experience of the incident
- like where they were in another room when someone else "shoot" someone else
- filling blanks of what has happened 
- potential fact of something happened 
- more circumstantial evidence we get around one evidence so the trier of fact can get closer to the truth 
## Testimonial Evidence
- most of the evidence are these evidence 
- butcher v. queen, giving evidence life 
- 
## Recorded Evidence
- from your phone, camera, CCTV
- if there are footage of bob shooting alan, then the recorded evidence is direct evidence
- if there is footage of bob dragging alan's body, then its a circumstantial evidence (no direct prove of the criminal act)
## Admission
- Accused just say they are guilty and say what they did 
- prove of giving up on something
- making the proceeding more efficient
- often times come across crim code section 655
- ***Where an accused is on trial for an indictable offence, he or his counsel may admit any fact alleged against him for the purpose of dispensing with proof thereof. 
- 
## Real evidence
- in a real physical state 
- DNA, blood samples, body of the person, SUV that crashed 
- exhibits in trial 
- real illustrative evidence - a photo of a gun used in the crime
- depiction of an evidence that we don't bring to court

#### [Case law - R. v. Villaroman, 2016 SCC 33 (CanLII)](https://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/2016/2016scc33/2016scc33.html?resultId=9d496829680c44e7832add530ea1c044&searchId=2026-02-06T09:12:36:843/7cd2258307d6446e93583a7003515061)
- what we don't want are juries filling in the blanks too early 
- a jury when looking at circumstantial evidence, they can only convict when there are substantial evidence and they are convinced
- we have to warn them about filling the blanks too early
- if there are any inference can be made then it is filling the blanks way too early
- ***If we look out the window and see that the road is wet, we may jump to the conclusion that it has been raining. But we may then notice that the sidewalks are dry or that there is a loud noise coming from the distance that could be street-cleaning equipment, and re-evaluate our premature conclusion. The observation that the road is wet, on its own, does not exclude other reasonable explanations than that it has been raining.
- if there are other reasonable alternative then we should not be drawing conclusions
- we can only draw conclusions when we are certain there are not other alternative 
- Guilty mind usually are proved in circumstantial evidence 
- like stealing cannot be accidental, Mens rea is fulfilled 
#### [John v. R., 1970 CanLII 199 (SCC)](www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/1970/1970canlii199/1970canlii199.html?resultId=51db4a611aed4f2f9bdaec9e5981f24c&searchId=2026-02-06T09:33:01:193/98555b6361fc4402b900eb6163a3dd4d)
- it is misleading to convince the jury to convict based on circumstantial evidence 
- ***Although the illustration was potentially misleading if it had stood alone, the fact that it was almost immediately followed by a correct statement of the effect to be given to circumstantial evidence, served to offset any wrong impression of the law which it might have left in the minds of the jurors.
- if thats all the evidence you have, you cannot say it is substantial evidence to convict someone
- ***Circumstantial evidence requires facts from which guilt is the only rational inference and if innocence is an equally rational inference there is no proof of guilt at all.
#### [R v Vader, 2016 ABQB 505 (CanLII)](https://www.canlii.org/en/ab/abqb/doc/2016/2016abqb505/2016abqb505.html?resultId=5bae9f5dbed14a55821e278850622aeb&searchId=2026-02-06T09:43:41:330/dbd0bc626fbf4d1484f0f342e80171d1)
- Basically all the evidence are circumstantial, witnesses giving evidence piecing this case together 
- ***The reliability of that evidence was challenged by the Defence; however I conclude that the criticism of these witnesses has no merit given their familiarity with the subject matter.
- ***The Defence argued that I(Judge) should consider potential alternative paths of travel, destinations, and so on, as potential and relevant alternative theories of what the McCanns did. I reject these submissions as empty hypotheses that are countered by the fact that physical evidence of the McCanns was subsequently recovered along their reported proposed path of travel.

#### [R. v. Nikolovski, 1996 CanLII 158 (SCC)](https://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/1996/1996canlii158/1996canlii158.html?resultId=148dfc9a390e44c289296de99d0a8439&searchId=2026-02-06T10:40:41:187/668488ad0cfb4da6a881fd6afd5ce45a)
- evidence being court should be presumed as unaltered 
- what about modern day? AI shit getting out of control 
- ***It may indeed be a silent, trustworthy, unemotional, unbiased and accurate witness who has complete and instant recall of events.  It may provide such strong and convincing evidence that of itself it will demonstrate clearly either the innocence or guilt of the accused.
- the form of evidence can make a different in the context of making it's admissibility

# Concept of Weight
- Weight and probative value are interchangable terms 
- how much faith, how much power to prove or dis-prove
- in order to evaluate an evidence's value its comes down to weight
- linked to the credibility to the witness
- whether an evidence is admissible is what we deal with first, then weight
- admissibility does not relate to weight, just because low weight does not mean its not admissible
-
