# Independent arbitrator
- only look at the evidence and facts infront of them
- *Crown*, not to seeks conviction but to present evidence
- They go first because of presumption of innocent 
- *persuasive but not binding* - stare decisis
- Judge is the trier of the law 
- Jury is the trier of the fact
- we don't trust Jury of the law
- most rules of evidence come from common law 
- prove or to disprove comes from common law, definition of wordings

#### [R. v. Sipes, 2009 BCSC 285 (CanLII)](https://www.canlii.org/en/bc/bcsc/doc/2009/2009bcsc285/2009bcsc285.html?resultId=d57c7a73669641ce8ccbb8415a18092e&searchId=2026-01-16T08:35:01:811/77cf63d2d93b4fe694da450af927eeb0)
- Judge wants to maintain the big 3 principle (certainty consistency predictability)
- "You dont have to create something everything when it is already there"

#### [David Polowin Real Estate Ltd. v. Dominion of Canada General Insurance Co., 2005 CanLII 21093 (ON CA)](https://www.canlii.org/en/on/onca/doc/2005/2005canlii21093/2005canlii21093.html?resultId=98adecbb30cc42729974221cf2190936&searchId=2026-01-16T08%3A54%3A05%3A477%2Fd6991e8172874a7086f258b498dbeb85&searchUrlHash=AAAAAQANc3RhcmUgZGVjaXNpcwAAAAAB&offset=297&highlightEdited=true)
- [119]*The values underlying the principle of stare decisis are well known: consistency, certainty, predictability and sound judicial [page191] administration. Adherence to precedent promotes these values.*
- [121] *But there is, of course, a price to be paid for rigid adherence to precedent: injustices in individual cases, continued application of legal principles long since outdated as society has changed, and uncertainty bred by judges who draw overly fine distinctions to avoid stare decisis.*
- is there a favour towards one side that will alter the results?
- conviction should be a result of a fair trial 

#### [R. v Harrer [1995] 3 S.C.R. 562 (S.C.C.)](https://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/1995/1995canlii70/1995canlii70.html?resultId=c7f6364f356646c29976c0d74f820546&searchId=2026-01-16T08:59:59:554/9523fbd6fda84fc387fb5be1df092ee9)
- Can we use the statement we obtain in US and use it in Canada, whether that evidence should be admissible 
- *Whether a particular piece of evidence would render a trial unfair is often a matter of some difficulty.  A distinction must be made at the outset between unfairness in the way a statement was obtained and an unfair process or trial.*
- *Even where every effort is made to comply with the law, aspects of the process may, in hindsight, be argued to have been less than fair.  Sometimes the unfairness is minor or rendered insignificant by other developments*
- Done things a little differently but will result in the same outcome? Fair possibly 
- ***unfairness in the way evidence is taken may affect the fairness of the admission of that evidence at trial, but does not necessarily do so.***
- thats why we have arguments about how admissible is an evidence
- Is there a problem with the way evidence is obtained? 
- ***Evidence may render a trial unfair for a variety of reasons.  The way in which it was taken may render it unreliable.  Its potential for misleading the trier of fact may outweigh such minimal value it might possess.***
- if is creates a unfair value then it should be kept out of the trial

# Evidence - Fundamental principle applicable to Accused 
- all evidence have a value we assign to it 
- when we are calling evidence, take the oauth and point to the accused - essential evidence that we pick
- in reality we don't know the prove of identification, how do we test that evidence as admissible - cross examination
- questions about the evidence, how accurate it is, what where when how who
- all things become an assessment of the weight of the evidence 
- starts out with the assessment of weight, into cross examination to prove beyond reasonable doubt
- obligation to testify an evidence? can the trier of fact conclude they did not testify therefore they are guilty 
	- no, presumption of innocent
	- moved away from prove beyond reasonable doubt
	- in jury trials when it becomes overwhelming, where's the limit of the big 3 principle
- Principle that applies to proceeding and trial also applies for forensics investigation, the way we deal with evidence

#### Presumption of Innocence
1. _**Woolmington v. DPP [1935] UKHL 1**_
	- Appeal towards not the accused to prove he is innocent, but Crown's duty to prove he is guilty by fact

#### Right to remain Silent 
1. **R. v. Noble, 1997 CanLII 388 (SCC) –**
	- no one can identify the accused in that trial 
	- identification and facial match? overwhelming admissible of the evidence
	- ***“almost an adverse inference” that “certainly may add to the weight of the Crown’s case on the issue of identification”***
	- Court of appeal say NAH and says right to silence 
	- Silence of the accused should not be used by the Crown in the case
	- ***the silence of the accused should not be used against him or her in building the case for guilt***
	- Look at the Crown's case instead of considering the Silence
	- if an accused do not give alibi to testify themselves, that should not be used against them 
	- it is easy to fabricate evidences, rejection of the silence of the accused
#### Prove beyond Reasonable Doubt
1. **R. v. Lifchus 1997 CanLII 319 (SCC)**
	- We do not have reasonable because out of sympathy 
	- ***"It is logically derived from the evidence or absence of evidence."***
	- ***"Even if you believe the accused is probably guilty or likely guilty, that is not sufficient.  In those circumstances you must give the benefit of the doubt to the accused and acquit because the Crown has failed to satisfy you of the guilt of the accused beyond a reasonable doubt."***
	- ***"On the other hand you must remember that it is virtually impossible to prove anything to an absolute certainty and the Crown is not required to do so.  Such a standard of  proof is impossibly high."***
	- Absolute certainty is not necessary
	- **You don't have to be absolute certain but you have to be sure**
	- "Its inviting you to wrestle how close these 2 things are"

#### Giving up to right to remain silence
1. **R. v. J.H.S., 2008 SCC 30**
	- victim says abc, accused says def
	- how we as trier of fact can determine the credibility of the evidence
	- credibility contest of error, we pick which one is the best to believe in (mistakes)
	- if you believe one evidence over another then its not Crown proving beyond reasonable doubt
	- WD instruction (OUTDATED), so use R. v. JHS instead
	- You cannot convict because you like one version better, thats not reasonable doubt
	- hence thats why this case is to point out to Juries of the importance of this
	- just because you don't believe the accused does not mean they are guilty
	- In this case the question is whether the judge instruction left the jury with the impression that they had to choose between 2 versions of the event
	- and this does not prove the accused to be guilty, evidence as not credible 
2. Police warning
	- warning about the charter rights for the accused 
	- right to be informed why they are arrested
	- Supplementary warning, if the accused wants legal counsel then not wanting to
	- if the accused gets interviewed by multiple officers, the upcoming officer should give secondary warning 
3. Charter rights
	- Section 10
	- Section 13 

#### Outer edge of the right of silence  
1. [R .v. Cyr 1997 CanLII 1039](https://www.canlii.org/en/bc/bcsc/doc/1997/1997canlii1039/1997canlii1039.html?resultId=e25219b9fc7c45cdbf8ff4ed2bf98af9&searchId=2026-01-16T10:43:08:771/3a67e7d2afc3471eb88a6764139f650d)
	- does a judge have the authority to allow Crown to remove the shirt of the accused to identify them 
	- Crown have harden their case to remove the shirt of the accused to confirm the tattoo to better identify
	- Judge says no, appeal says yes why not
	- "The judge should not be ordering you to participate in the crown's case against you" - From Ryan
	- This case strips the accused right of silence away (the identification evidence)
	- Ryan's main argument is this case goes against the charter 

2. [R. v. Turcotte, 2005 SCC 50 (CanLII)](https://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/2005/2005scc50/2005scc50.html?resultId=a54246faa6844a1ba13a236dff6edf2e&searchId=2026-01-16T11:02:23:505/43a37f6294b049dcb976b59a89e5bdad)
	- post offence guilty, evidence that showed you did it and you are guilty of it 
	- ***"The evidence of the accused’s silence was not admissible as post‑offence conduct."
	- even if you talk to the police that does not mean you give up the right to remain silent 
	- evidence can be admissible for one purpose but not another one 

#### Why do we have trials?
- when we have a trial is to see if someone should be held accountable for an action
- access it with law, and based on fact, and facts comes from evidence
- "this is what i accept as a fact and this is my decision based on that"
- if we cannot have certainty, the accused is not guilty
- the assessment comes from the evaluation of the evidence and decide by the trier of facts
- both sides making argument of the assessment that it is reliable and should be used to make a decision
