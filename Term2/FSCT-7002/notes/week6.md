# Bad Character of the accused
## General rule:
- it is inadmissible by the crown against the accused
- past criminal record, is inadmissible by the crown 
- this type of evidence have a low weight, high prejudice value
- "oh they have done it before, therefore the must have done it again" moral prejudice
- evidence of what they have done are not what they have done this time
## Character Evidence
- evidence says the accused is a bad person
- crown comes in and say they are bad people
- its prejudice from the Crown to the accused
- except the accused puts their character at issue 
- when during cross-examination, "Oh look at how good I am" - Crown calls their previous criminal records
- Basically Crown pushing back the accused "bad take" 
- example like a murder case "I never killed someone, that person is dangerous and i protect myself" "Crown: nah this negro is violent bro look at his previous record"
## [R. v. Handy, 2002 SCC 56](https://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/2002/2002scc56/2002scc56.html?resultId=90e978e4ff5746fe9b824d44dd2271a4&searchId=2026-02-19T19:17:07:058/8cb4967b4fc0490892c8b83f131d67d5)
***The exception***
- the probative value out-weights the prejudice value
- "almost like a signature of the accused"
- we see its so unique of this person, then the prejudice values goes down 
- They have committed these criminal act before, high prejudice low probative
***Introduction
- rough sex - anal sex and the wife no likey
- supreme court comes in and says *no*, the trial judge made bad decision
- **Collusion** - if people can compare and come to the same conclusion
- these women can talk about it with such similarity making it inadmissible 
- they agreed on certain act - but the women says it became abusive
- called their ex-wife, she says it was abusive when he gets drunk and don't take no
- supreme court says the case is not similar enough, the probative value does not goes up 
- *credibility on the consent issue*
***The Problem
- evidence of Collusion
	- if we allow similar fact evidence in, its because the previous and this case are so similar, it has to be the same person
	- and that the same person would do this again
	- It is not a coincidence
	- if it is a coincidence, collusion goes out the window because they victim might have made a up story
	- the similarities is gone because of that collusion
-  we need to be extremely careful when there is any evidence of collusion between parties that are giving evidence at a trail
- then of instances of prior disreputable conduct that are being considered for similar fact evidence
- ***"To infer guilt from a knowledge of a character of the accused is a forbidden type of reasoning"
- ***"Exclusion of evidence of general propensity(natural tendency) or disposition has been repeatedly affirmed in this court and is not controversial"**
***What is the reason for exclusionary rule?***
- some case is relevant some don't
- potential to be prejudice
- distraction of the jury will outweight the prejudice value against probative value 
- thats not how our system works, Canada system works around people turning to be better 
- there is a natural tendency of human doing pattern recognition
- once the jury hears it then they have a prejudice mindset of the accused
- "they are so similar, thats not a coincidence"
- "The man who wins the lottery once is envied. The man who wins it twice is investigated"
***Conclusion**
- normally probative value is too low, potential for prejudice too high
- when that starts to reverse and the probative value outweighs the potential for prejudice, thats when we allow it to come in 
- the closely connected and similar the acts are, the more the probative value goes up
- the similarities cannot be explained by coincidence any longer

# Evidence from witnesses
- lawyers are not witness, they put evidence in at a bail hearing or sentencing when there has not been a trial 
- if witness comes in, said what they had told the police and not what the tell us
- we would have to cross-examine, withdrew his counsel, and come in and give evidence

## Notorious Facts
- judge does not need to have evidence of to consider as proven in a trial 
- facts, like the sun, rain falls 
- judge can consider things without evidence that there are no dispute over it 
- "Judicial notice of the the fact that Stanley Park is in BC"
## [Regina v. Potts, 1982 CanLII 1751](https://www.canlii.org/en/on/onca/doc/1982/1982canlii1751/1982canlii1751.html?resultId=1bbf13254633454e82981c5ba42d2b41&searchId=2026-02-19T20:48:21:376/258444bc1acb4ab792cd55aa5b4447c9)
- look there are signs everywhere, cars, clearly the driveway of street is under the control of the National Capital Commission
- the street was in the NPC
- Judicial Notice
	- ***"is the acceptance by a court or judicial tribunal, without the requirement of proof, of the truth of a particular fact or state of affairs that is of such general or common knowledge in the community that proof of it can be dispensed with. The doctrine is thus said to be an exception to the general rule that a judge or jury may consider only evidence which has been tendered in court and may not act on personal knowledge"***
	- ***" judicial notice of matters of fact is founded upon that fund of knowledge and experience which is common to both judges and jurors and is not confined to the bench so it has to be such common knowledge"***
- fact that was notorious a century ago may not apply as common knowledge 
- even if Judge or Jury may or may not share the common knowledge, they can still take judicial notice
- basically that person will have to agree with other people that its just a common knowledge
- if a judge know DNA evidence, but they cannot call judicial notice because it is not common knowledge (verse like chungus like ne)
- it needs to be common to the community 
## Exceptions
- s. 714.1 - audio or video conference if the court thinks the sub section are fulfilled
- s. 714.2 - if witness outside of Canada, but needs to be ensured no one is coaching them
- s. 714.6 - legal deemed to be giving in Canada even if they are outside of the country 
- s. 715.1 - what if the witness dies, narrow exception
	- preliminary > direct > cross
	- and then the witness dies, they can apply to get the evidence of video recording form previous trial 
	- its may be admitted, needs to consider the weights of the evidence 
- s. 715.1 (1) - common for child witness complaint (under 18)
	- a child is victimized and tells the evidence to the police 
	- what if the proceeding takes too long and their memory gets worse
	- so the video recorded evidence comes in 
	- has to be made in a reasonable time of the offence 
	- when they have to present that evidence, then the child would have to come in and say it was them (in a Voir Dire), unless defense can convince there are major issues
	- coming out of the Voir Dire will form the direct evidence of that person at trial
	- they can ask more questions in direct, but will be subjected to cross
- s. 715.1 (2) - for mental or physical disability, same requirements as above 
- s. 486.2 (1) - exception for 650
	- shall order to take evidence outside of the court room 
	- to protect the witness, that they would not see the accused 
	- mandatory 

# Rule of Hearsay
General rule is hearsay is inadmissible, but there are a ton of exception
***Definition***
- It is taken out of court and not under oath
- calling the evidence saying that is true 
- generally it is admissible in court, this is hearsay
***Example***
- "Bob tells me...."
- if the party is trying to put this statement in to prove if someone was it Bob's place
- you can believe and trust what bob says 
- that is hearsay, that is inadmissible 
- we need to put weight on this statement, we need cross-examination
***Why and What to do?***
- cross examination is important in a trial 
- When you have a report or something that's written by another person, that's hearsay
- And if you want to put something that's written by a person who's not coming into court into trial as evidence, you've got to find an exception to the rule
- you need to get that person who did the report into court
## Exception
***Party of Exception***
- Anything that the accused has said to people can be used against them as an exception under the party's exception of the hearsay rule
- because the accused is in court, they can give evidence and go cross-examined 
## Example
- witness W says bob told me this and that happened, so they didnt go in the house in check if anyone is there 
- if W is saying why they didnt go and check in a house, its not being put forward for the truth of what bob said
- its just for the fact why and how W perceived things in a certain 
- its called state of mind of the hearer, or put forward of the statement was said, not hearsay
- hearsay only when the party is putting the evidence in as considered true
- if W in court says: Bob told me he went to victim's house and no one is there 
- objection hearsay, but we are not trying to prove what bob said is true
- we need to know what W did 
- not to prove there is no one the house
- if we need to prove that, call Bob and cross examine that guy 
- s. 486.2 (1) exception
