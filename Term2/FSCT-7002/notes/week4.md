# Ronald Cotton's case
- Eyewitness misidentification
- god knows how many wrongful conviction there are 
- DNA testing exclusively stating he is not the 
- he convinced 2 lawyer to overturn this decision
#### Eyewitness identification and testimony 
- powerful impact at trial of a witness for the prosecution stating with confidence and conviction that the accused was the person observed committing the crime
- erroneous and mistaken identifications have and do occur
- 78% of 130 (101) conviction are mistaken identification
- The positive identification of an accused is an essential element of any offence
#### Macfarlane Paper
- "the single most important factor leading to wrongful convictions"
- officer not investigating on the case should the one presenting the evidence (people to choose from)
- ^ independent arbitrators 
#### Case Law
- ***Courts have long recognized the frailties of identification evidence given by independent, honest and well-meaning eyewitnesses.[**[128]**](https://www.justice.gc.ca/eng/rp-pr/cj-jp/ccr-rc/pmj-pej/p5.html#foot128 "Footnote 128")
- ***A first time in-dock identification, though admissible,[**[135]**](https://www.justice.gc.ca/eng/rp-pr/cj-jp/ccr-rc/pmj-pej/p5.html#foot135 "Footnote 135") has little weight and has particular frailties over and above the normal frailties associated with identification evidence.
- ***"It is therefore considered undesirable and unsatisfactory"
- ***If an eyewitness’s evidence becomes stronger with the passage of time as the matter proceeds through the court, this may imply that the identification is in fact “post-event reconstruction,” which undermines its reliability.
- if the confidence level increases of the identification, the memory is being overwritten
- if witness find out information of the accused, they can be more confident in what they believe in 
- ***If an eyewitness’s evidence becomes stronger with the passage of time as the matter proceeds through the court, this may imply that the identification is in fact “post-event reconstruction,”
- ***Weak identification evidence may be enhanced by other circumstantial evidence so as to render a verdict reasonable
- ^ DNA, video evidence, strengthen the identification evidence
- ***Where the police use improper procedures in obtaining identification evidence, the evidence can be left with the jury. But the trial judge should caution the jury on the circumstances in which the identification evidence was obtained.[](https://www.justice.gc.ca/eng/rp-pr/cj-jp/ccr-rc/pmj-pej/p5.html#foot143 "Footnote 143")

- in criminal trial, the crown should not enter the accuse's criminal record 
- "previous 4 DUI", crown cannot use this if he commit ts again 
- conviction based on bad impression, "this guy did it already, therefore they do it again"

#### Exceptions
- bailing hearing or sentencing as guilty plea, lawyers can give the evidence to the judge
-  what your criminal record is relevant to the sentencing and bailing, depends on how the evidence is presented in front of trier of fact
-  what matters in sentencing is different than in a trial, relevance and materiality is scenario dependent  
- what the charge is the accused is facing 

# Witnesses
#### 3 types of witness
1. Civilians
	1.  statements, this does not form evidence in court
	2. they speak in court is the evidence 
	3. passive witness
	4. they are called upon to relate statement to a police officer
2. Police/Professional witness
	1. drive by, see some mfs fighting, pulls over
	2. they have a positive duty to collect evidences, to observe, to record
	3. paid and trained to do ts 
3. Expert witness
	1. offers opinion of a fact or an issue based on their professional background
	2. DNA, finger prints experts, blood samples (Dexter)
	3. approved by the judge to do so 
	4. Crown or accused both can call them, by one of the parties 

#### General rule
- opinion evidence is admissible 
- WE DO NOT GIVE A FLYING FUCK OF YOUR OPINION LIBTARD
- civilian/lay witness can give opinion based on the compenius statement of facts
- how do you parse out the fact from the opinion, the line can be very difficult to determine
- if they personally observed the crime, brain calculates the conclusion, trying to explain what your brain is doing is impossible

- based on personal observation, convinent sound bites
- you can give degree of evidence, even though it might take time to process the information, a gradient 
- ***The value of opinion will depend on the view the court takes in all the circumstances.
- you need to see it yourself to give that opinion
- ***We start with the reality that the law of evidence is burdened with a large number of cumbersome rules, with exclusions, and exceptions to the exclusions, and exceptions to the exceptions.
- what we might think its fact might just be a strong opinion
- Supreme court solves this by returning to broad principles
- ***The witnesses had an opportunity for personal observation. They were in a position to give the Court real help. They were not settling the dispute. They were not deciding the matter the Court had to decide, the ultimate issue. The judge could accept all or part or none of their evidence.
- "We don't need an expert to know if this guy is drunk yo"
- ***The weight of the evidence is entirely a matter for the judge or judge and jury. The value of opinion will depend on the view the court takes in all the circumstances.
- just because something is admissible or not, doesn't mean the case is determined by that
- voir deir required to summon an expert witness, because it is particularly dangerous 
- when juries hearing an expert comes in and give their take, they will heavily rely on that
- one piece of evidence is not substantial evidence for the whole case, wrong place at the wrong time

- they are qualified in one trial, do they have to do that in every other trial? no
- how we quality expert opinion
- it needs to be relevant, necessary, absence of an exclusionary rule and special expertise (4 Mohan Factors)
- ***It ensures that the trial does not devolve into “trial by expert” and that the trier of fact maintains the ability to critically assess the evidence
- its not decided by "which expert do i trust more"
- ***"The evidence must be logically relevant to a fact in issue"
