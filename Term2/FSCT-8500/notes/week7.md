# Collecting Mobile Evidence
3 main tools, Cellebrite, Verakey, Axion (Best to least advanced)
logical, file system, physically extraction and locked devices
logical is what you see what you get
file system can be obtain from all Android and some iphones (when they first launch)
physical is not possible on ios, depends on Android 
how do we know? we don't until we try
each time Cellebrite updates, there will be new models
we can bruteforce password protection if the device is locked (Verakey)
