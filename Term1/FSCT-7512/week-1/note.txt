Week 1 - Cloud Forensics

nothing special really - unless you are andrew and slept through every single lecture in cit 

1. Cloud Pros 
	A. Scalability
		- Horizontal Scalability
			> Just slap more VMs duh
		- Vertical Scalability
			> Just slap more CPUs duh

		Forensics computers requires more resources so scalabilty is good 

		Benefits: Cost saving, Accessibility, Disaster recovery


	B. Where the fuck are we (Totally was listening)
		- IaaS
			> Infrastructure is provided, like servers, OS, shit is configured by you
			> It has the highest level of access and control by the DF team
			> Usually will work with IaaS provider response team
		- PaaS
			> Platform is ready to build or deploy ad manage applications without configuration
			> When there is a icnident, we would require access from the user and the Cloud provider
			> Usually it requires legal actions to have access from private companys
			> HSPII, Highly sensitvie Personal Identifiable Information
			> Companies would want local servers as security management is easier within the same country
		- Saas
			> Ready, cloud based solution that someone is managing for you 
			> Lowest level of control for a DFIR team
			> Team must work with Cloud Provider 
			> You have 0 control with the service
		- DaaS
		- FaaS

	C. Deployment Models
		- Public Cloud
		- Private Cloud
		- Hybrid Cloud
		- Community Cloud

		> Who has access to my data? We never know 

		Global Legal Regulations
			- How the data should be stored, viewed on cloud
			- Individuals have the right to access, rectify and erase their personal information
			- In EU, you would have to work with the EU investigation team 
			- Data must be perserved within EU
			- Californai Consumer Privacy Act- CCPA
		
		Managing Cyber Risks
			- Security measures
			- The "Doomsday" Rule
			- Step by step incident response guide
		
		E-Discovery
			- Electronic Discovery - identifying and producting data sored in digital format as part of a investigation
			- Anything thats is relevant to investigation

	D. Digital Forensics Challenges
		> Data Size - It could be infinite
		> Technical/Skills Challenges
			
	E. Legal implication of data retnetion
		> Breach notification law
		 	- Breacehes notification laws requires organizations to notify affected entities in event of a breach
