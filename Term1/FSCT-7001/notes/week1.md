Criminal event > Investigation > Charge Approval > Prov. Court proc., pre-trial procedures > disclosure > Jury Trial > Sentencing (Sometimes happens) 

Most crimes are not reported, most crimes are still investigating, some are still in charge approval 

Understand what affect the people in the case

people can be wrongly accused, wrong place at the wrong time

false complaints, and shit happens

a lot of time it happens are based on assumptions, your brain subconsciously fill in the blanks

human brains hates gaps about information, so it will try to predict what it is in that blank

it only happens when you have limited information

Example: This mf aura farming, we don't fully know this guy but we are filling the gaps of our curiousity already

Allow the system works it way out, don't allow yourself to make unchecked and wrongful assumptions. We need to be conscious of it

Remove and push back the the assumption, try to move away from it as much as possible, notice that its there and try to minimize the cause from it 

there are consequences to what you do

Crown is the power of all

In a criminal case, one party always holds the crown, acting on behalf of the community to act actions by the government 

Style of cost tells you who is battling out the case

Crown is represented as R, which means "King" in latin

R. v. Ryan Johnson - This means Ryan is fighing againt the Crown, and this is a criminal case 

Some older cases - HMTQ. v. Joe Bloggins (Her Magesty The Queen)
