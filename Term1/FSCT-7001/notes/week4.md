    > case study

        - police close case and not continue investigation
        - more complaints down the year
        - police in different juristiction decides there are not enough evidence to submit to the crown council
        - 2005 started the process to 2012
        - 2012 police reinvestigate
        - put alert, more complaints, more investigation
        - 2013 first charge, start of the proceeding
        - 2016 3 months trial with 7 charges, 6/7 guilty charges

        - objective standards
        - make decision about charging, bail, running trail, assuming they are innocient 
    
    > police
        - primary duty: keep the (public) peace and prevent breach of it
        - second duty: if not 1, investigate about the incident
        - present in the community (so basically patrols)
        - it helps to prevent the breach of the peace
        - (The police in the Tim hortons) (frfr)
        - they main thing to do is to find out what happened with an event
        - the goal is not to put someone in jail, if they can prove a crime
        - if they start with a conclusion, they are tunnel visioned and have confirmation bias
        - come up wiht a hypothesis that they are goign to test with data
        - gathering evidence
        - submit to the crown council
        - depends on the decisionm either stop investigation or gather more evidence
        
        > displacement theory
            - with the present of police, it will stop the crime
            - if you know the problematic area and police go to it, people just go other place and keep doing it
            - it did not stop the crime
            - hence "displacement"
            - *Whistling Smith*

        > Broken windows theory
            - if target smaller crime, it will give the area impression of the good area
            - if there are broken windwos, peoeple will think this place is shit
            - if neighbour hood seems nice, no crime theory
            - does not work dumbahh 
            
        > Complaint
            - someone thinks someone's actions are wrong/harmful
            - the victim usually makes the complaints
            - sometimes not criminal, police past it to someone else to investigate (another branch of gov.)
            > police initiated complaint
                - drugs transactions in public 
                - police see something and initate it
