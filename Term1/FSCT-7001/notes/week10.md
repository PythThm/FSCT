#### Scenario
- court room, call evidence, proceeding
- to get the result, verdict
- prove or disprove in the proceeding/trial
- rules related to evidence in proceeding 
- evidence comes from witness, living voice, speak to the judge
- testify their first hand experiences, testimony in court about a person's memory of event
- our justice system relies on human memory
- witnesses take OAuth, relive the memories of the event
1. Civilians
	- Regular civilians
	- normal people gets called into court thats not a professional
	- proceeding > comes in > gives evidence
	- there is a way for civilian to make a opinion is when majority of people have that opinion, a clear expectation
2.  Police
	- Have training in how to show evidence
	- gets paid as their job
	- positive duty and obligation to record how they get the evidence
	- duty of actively witnessing evidence, duty of investigate
	- record of what they are doing, documentations of the process
	- main way of documentation is hardcopy of notebook
	- body camera does not give all the context of the situation
	- notebook lets you put down more information and better details on a case
	- until the court qualifies them as experts
3. Expert
	- until the court qualifies them as experts
	- allowed to give opinion based evidence
	- based on their professions and expertise, not their experience of things
	- eg: DNA, blood splatter (Dexter)
	- '2 samples of blood, there might only be 1 in a million chance it aint from the same person'

# Jury Trial
- trier of the law (judge)
- trier of the facts (decision of what evidence to believe, guilty or not)
- we don't trust the jury 
- judge decides what applies, common law, legislation
- facts are find in the evidence, end with a result of a trial
- benefit to the accused to get convicted by Juries 
- social and collective interests 

#### R. v. Turpin 1989 CanLII 98 (SCC)
- ensure the interests of the accused are respected
- gives an accused the right of benefits
- examination of the nature and purpose of the guarantee of a jury trial contained in s.11 (f) of the charter
- jury serves collective and social interests in addiction to protecting the individual
- social purposes primarily by acting as a vehicle of public education
- people come to court, learn about the court, stuff about the system by getting involved
- lends the weight of community standards to trial verdict
- they will view from thee community's perspective, lends the community values
- by involving people in it, it adds legitimacy to the system 
- what does it mean by "benefit"?
- s.11f, legislation declares it as "good"
- importing a qualification on the right to a jury trial
