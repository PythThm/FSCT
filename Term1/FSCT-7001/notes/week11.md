#### CROWN ALWAYS GOES FIRST
- Foundation and Fundamental level (The Big 3s)
- Crown's duty is to prove the case, their responsibility
- Show how the accused is guilty
- And the court decides what to do
- They start by a opening address to the Jury
- This is not adovacy, not to seek conviction to get people in prison
- roadmap for the juries, what is going to happening in the trial
- Opening is not evidence, is what to expect like calling witness
- To prove that this person on this timeframe committed this crime
- idea to the Jury of whats going to happen
- Where to pay attention to, overview from the Crown to provide the context
- Then the Crown calls the case for Witnesses
- Call witness, Direct examination, Chronological order
- Ask them open-ended question, to support the Crown's case, present exhibites through the witness
- to see if its reliable, recall events, each defendant lawyer have their chance to cross examine the witness
- witness can be reexamined after the cross examination is over
- If Crown thinks the witness alters the case bit too much, then the above can happen (apply)
- Normal this don't happen, only when something is unfair or unpredictable that happens
- Crown goes through every witness, and close the case
- every essential element has to be proven beyond a reasonable doubt
- Accused can remain silence and not call witness or evidence
- Or decide to call evidence or call themselves as witness (others as well)
- They never ever have to, they can be silence the whole way
- If they do give evidence themselves to cross examine
- they go through the same steps as the Crown does
- Crown comes up and cross examine them (direct)
- Everything is done when defending side calling is done, then case of the accused is over
- If defend counsel calls a case, its possible for CC to apply to rebuttal of evidence
- "Necessity defence", "Rebuttal evidence"
- if the CC could not see it coming, judge allows for rebuttal
- if defence doesn't call evidence, Crown makes closing statement first then Defence
- If they do, Defence makes closing statement first then Crown
- Tactical Advantage, making closing statement last to appeal to the Jury
-
