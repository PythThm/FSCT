    - post-offence conduct, refuse to respond to the question makes it guilty
    - SCC says no, they says right to silence would be non-sense

    - even if you believe they are guilty, it is still not guilt of the accused beyond a reasonable doubt
    - it is impossible to prove anything to an absolute certaintly and crown is not required to do so
    - if based on evidence, you are sure that accused comited the offence you should convict with reasonable doubt
    - Wrongful cases -> lies 
    - You need to point to the evidence to proof it might be a lie

> R. v. Sanchez, 2017 ONCA 9944
    - sexual assault allegation 
    - the trail judge did not have any basis to make a conclusion if the evidence could be based on a lie
    - SCC says no
    - too many reason why someone might lie, and its unknown
