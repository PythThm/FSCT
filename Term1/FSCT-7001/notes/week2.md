# Review
The crown just means that government now rules over and is trusted to the govenernment

It represents us

Parties and legal disputes, represented by council(lawyers)

Global crown of canada - { R. v. Ryan Johnson }

Crimnial case - { Baucher v. The Queen }

The party on the left brings the action to the party on the right

You can do whatevr to the accused, protection law is inplace to protect the victims
Publication ban on the victims name 

Re Hansurd S. Mills
- Re means as a reference, government brings it in to the court
- reference case, not criminal, settlement

## Civil case
**Ryan John. v. Moron Neighbour**

**Ryan John. v. Valerie John.** -- child dispute case

Left side is always the one to bring actions

## Neural arbitrator

Individual arbiration - arbitrator need to have no relation or connections with either side of the parties
As the judge cannot have a neutral judgement as they might already have a pre-judgement on the case

---

Alibi - a claim that the accused were at a different location when the crime occured
You need to raise this earlier so there would be an opportunity of someone looking into it for evidence

Federal government can make criminal law based on section 91 subsection 27 ( s.91 (27) )

s.92(13) - Provincal Prooperty and civil rights
each province have their own motor vehicle act
