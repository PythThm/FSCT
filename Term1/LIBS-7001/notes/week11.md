# Argument
- sources, experts testimony, goes both logos and ethos
- present personal experience, statistics if the topic can be proven by numbers
- emotional appeals pathos

# Logos
- Primary, secondary, statistical datas
- The film we are analyzing the film is primary, all kinds of visuals, effects, sounds, space
- Support the analysis with common sense, right conclusion, secondary sources to support claims
- Court cases, government document, police reports, witness testimony are primary cases
- statistics of indigenous women being murdered
#### Supporting a logical appeal
- Authorities opinions
- Personal experiences (in some cases to strengthen the argument)
- Established truths that is basically common sense

#### Approaches to argument
- Induction, we make observations and conclusions, assumptions
- rely on previous experience to make an argument
- Deduction starts with a widely accepted observation and show how a conclusion can follow up 

#### Induction
- selective sampling
- example: treatment, focus only on the good benefits but not the bad ones
- not bias sampling

#### Deduction & Syllogisms
- syllogism, 3 sets of statements in specific order
- Types of Syllogisms: Categorical, Hypothetical, Alternative, Enthymeme (very useful for rhetoric)
- Major premise: observe and conclude
- Minor premise: share the major feature of the class
- Conclusion: A statement
