- basic things we agree, generous behaviour

#### Maslow's hierarchy of needs
- ads, analyze them 
- made hirerachy of human desires
- appeal to something
- "Buying social status"
- individual needs, targetted ads

#### Challenges of Persuasion
- how public image is changed
- Johnny Depp's case, 5 years of exiling to the europe (no hollywood)
- Importance of Ethos in the public

- Credibility of the speaker, "seems like a good character" is not a valid credibility
- The sentiment of a people or community
