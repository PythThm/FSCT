# SHITS
> Nicholas Carr 2010 - *What the Internet Is Doing to Our Brains The Shallows*

    - You heard something happen, read the news on BBC, you dont have to listen to the news
    - Carr focus on real time event on the internet

    - if we are constantly invited to click links, we dont remember and reflect on it (think about that shit)
    - we neglect our brain exercise, and not process information we receive
    
    > Memory    
        - Long and short term memory comparison

        - Carr thinks that Internet does not promote long-term memory, which contribute to brain capability
        - Beware of your attention span
        - He concludes what seperate us from niggas is our ability to control our attention with our will, to control what we think and focus on, and how to make meaning out of what select.
