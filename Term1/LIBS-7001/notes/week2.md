# Week 2 

We sometimes use language to maintain our connection, even though the conversation might be meaningless

How do we look for bias in text?
    - Text can be everything, ads, facebook, visual novel
    - When we see text, we need to look at its discourse
    - How is newspaper editorial different from other articles, most of it is an bias opinion
    - It mostly will align with the audience perspective (political, preference, etc)
    - Bias depends on the target audience to meet the expectations
    - Its important to check the source before reading forward
    - Often politicians simplify ideologies to promote themselves 
    - We should be aware of simplified informations, and dig deeper
    - Simplifying information is a common bias way to spread information
    - Avoid "I like it" "I don't like it", provide evidence to back up your claim
    - Always ask ourselves about the target audience

## Purpose
- Express feelings 
- Informative
- Persuasive

Meaningless text can have meaning if there is a clear message 

We exposes agenda, that nothing is unbias statement. The process of berbalizing thoughts and transmitting ideas involves the simultaneous signaling of purpose, aim and wishes along the message

## Audience
- Could be anyone, from one to one, one to many
- Consider the social status, education level and knowledge, and other social factors
