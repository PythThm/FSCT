# Similarity and contrary

- Definition of terms
- why choose that specific criteria, rhethorical decisions
- comparison between the inequality 
- Scale of value hides the rhethorical stands
- how to argue with contrary examples
- Great politician vs the traitor
- using contrary in cataline

> compare
    - natural
    - abstract
    - compare to common things
    - to understand the unfamiliar
    - seek for the criteria for comparison

> similarity
    - difference between induction and analogy (midterm)
    - what is induction?
        - statistic prediction, pattern recognition
        - to strengthen your claim, more evidence (how algorithms are build)
        - it is persuasice when numbers are present
        - strength of science is inductive 
        - compare things in the same class, humans to humans
    - analogy
        - it cannot replace evidence, but it still can strengthen the argument
        - it does not compare things with the same class
        - use cautiously, compare these similar things 

    > argument from similarity
        - Martin lurther king arrest
        - look at the fundamental different, analogy can mkae your argument strong but not concrete proof 
        - figurative and literal 
        - 

## Game theory
> Comparision
    - real and virtual world
    - insights with comparing similarities
    - analogies, comparing the same thing but in different class
    - you get facts, but comes down to how you use them 

> It is analogy
    - 2 different classes of things, real vs virutal
    - insightful, but one thing does not apply to the other
    - game dev moderating the market vs government monitoring free market
    - can you affect in game economy just like in real life? vice versa?

## DEFINTION
> Analogy
    - to clarify, to argue
    - explain things difficult to understand, like philosophy
    - compare vivid image, compare knowledge to fire, the concept of it
    - extended metaphor or simile

    **Example**
        1.
        - comparing things different classes with similiarities
        - start with the premise, sovereignty with their territory
        - the analogy is weak, nations big tribes small, so does size affect how much control over the land 
        
        2. photographs
        - elements being compared, people and trees 
        - relates rescilience of humans
        - look at nature, and look for the common things for both

    **Persuasive of analogy**
        - the essence of the similarity that contribute to the factors of both things
        - dont disregard the dissimilarity when comparing
        - the example of analogy should change based on the concext (talking to stupid people vs with kevin)
        - we say "what if we compare", imagining
        - 

    **TYPES**
        > Literal analogy
            - actual and substantial similarity between 2 cases

        > Figurative Analogy
            - comparision with metaphors
            - not literal
            - can still be used to make a political point
            - "Harper of Afghan", "Softwood lumber deal"

> Parody
    - repeat the original to make new thing
    - works as "hear this again"
    - ironic signaling of difference by similarity
    - a deliberate message from the wirter
    - quickly recognized
    - subjective??
    **FUNCTIONS OF PARODY**
        - listen again how you are manipulated
        - expose the lie
        - often political agendas
        - SIEG HEIL RESTORE WORLD PEACE BY EXILING ALL JEWS (schizo aside but that basically left right wing propaganda)
        -   
    
> Irony
    - sarcastic
    - similar to parody
    - more suttle
    - be able to recogize irony ot understand the context  
    - hard to define


> Contrast
    - use to argue, for confirmation or refutation
    - in 'cataline', comparing 2 groups of conspirators for his argument
    - "Marcellus loot the enemy, while Verres stolen from allies"
    - both are stealing, but the character traits makes it different
    - "Nobody died when Clinton died"
    - George bush claiming iran having weapon of mass destruction

> Parables
    - comparing alongside
