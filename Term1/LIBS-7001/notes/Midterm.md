#### 2.  Intent
- The writer purpose of the definition
- What is being defined

## Descriptive vs Prescriptive
#### Descriptive
1. Focus: How things are
2. Approach: Objective observation and analysis
3. Goal: To understand and document current usage, variation, and patterns
4. Example: A linguist studying how people use "ain't" in a dialect is being descriptive

#### Prescriptive
1. Focus: How things should be, putting meaning
2. Approach: Setting rules and standards
3. Goal: To enforce correctness and achieve a specific standard
4. Example: A teacher correcting a student's grammar for not following a specific rule is being prescriptive

# Functions of Parody
1. Ironic signalling of difference by similarity
2. A deliberate message from the writer
3. "listen again to this thing and see how ridiculous it is"
4.  Reveals Political Agendas 
5. "Is a repetition with critical distance which allows ironic signaling of differences at the very heart of similarity"
6. Primary function is "critical reworking of history" because it creates a "critical distance"

# Analogy
#### 1. Definition of Analogy
- A comparison between two different things that will relate in someway. It helps clarify a argument
- Explain things difficult to understand, like philosophy
- compare vivid image, compare knowledge to fire, the concept of it
- extended metaphor or simile
 
#### 2. Types of Analogy
1. Literal Analogy
	- Actual and substantial similarity between the two cases
	- Real logical relationships
2. Figurative Analogy 
	- comparison with metaphors between two elements
	- not literal
	- can still be used to make a political point
	- "Harper of Afghan", "Softwood lumber deal"

#### 3.Examples of Analogies
- "A Computer's CPU is like the brain - it process information and controls the system"
- "Time is like a river - it flows continuously and never returns once it passes"

#### 4. Comparison to Induction
 Analogy is based on similarity where as induction is more based on observation, almost like a generalization (i.e. of induction: "Every swan I've seen is white, therefore all swans are white")

#### 5. Important to Remember
- The similarities between two things must concern significant aspects of the two things
- The analogy must not ignore pertinent dissimilarities between the two things being compared

	- like recommendation letter, you write something what they done, specific details
2. Invective
