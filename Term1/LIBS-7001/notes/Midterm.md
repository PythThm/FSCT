# Analogy
## 1. Definition of Analogy
	- A comparison between two different things that will relate in someway. It helps clarify a argument

## 2. Types of Analogy
	1. Literal Analogy
		- Actual and substantial similarity between the two cases
	2. Figurative Analogy Analogy
		- comparision with metaphors between two elements
		- not literal
		- can still be used to make a political point
		- "Harper of Afghan", "Softwood lumber deal"

## 3.Examples of Analogies
	- "A Computer's CPU is like the brain - it process information and controls the system"
	- "Time is like a river - it flows contiuously and never returns once it passes"

	 Anology is based on similarity where as induction is more based on observation, almost like a generalization (ie of induction: "Evey swan I've seen is white, therefore all swans are white")

## 5. Important to Remember
	- The similarities between two things must concern significant aspacts of the two things
	- The analogy must not ignore pertinent dissimilarities between the two things being compared
