# Research Paper
- select a scene, refer to that and be specific
- avoid using vague wordings, like "Strong symbolisms"
# Pathos
-  emotional fallacies from last week
- if no ethos or logos, resort to pathos (but not as effective)
- Hitler's Mein Kampf was an example of it 
- She expect the usage of pathos to be strength of ethos, not in manipulative way 
- mostly used in politics, celebrities, not in academia 
- emotional scene from romeo and juliet
- blackmailing from athenians, inefficient and psychological manipulating
- hitler's pathological hate towards jews??? does not matter where it came from, or a strategy 
- technics of persuasion, tapping into their desire, guessing the minds of the audience
- you should not dismiss an argument because its pathos 
- start with strong moral framework, refuting from other standpoint like logos and add pathos
#### Motivation and persuasion
- values systems, MLK Christian's beliefs, morality
- sometimes you can find ethos and pathos in the same sentence
- strong words to appeal to emotions (basically what i did in my intro??)
- "Join my club and you will have a great time"
- if the risk is not too much, people are unlikely to accept the argument
- **Consistency theory**, erase the anxiety of the audience but not to scare them too much
- "Climate Change activists, Arguments about actions to protect earth"
	1. Increasing anxiety about the urgency of the problem
	2. Reducing anxiety about the impact of the change
	3. Offering significant rewards for change

#### Conveying an Emotional Appeal
- they can change the emotion by their voice, change of tone
- public speaking, power of words 
- in *Finding Dawn*, its interviews with the family (it really breaks your heart)
- face expression, sadness from their voices, scenes

#### The problem
- people dont have to believe in what they are saying, they can pretend to be so 
- why we need to develop the skill to reject pathos, and seek ethos and logos
- we as critical thinking only would say "no" out of instinct
- "give us evidence, give us stats"
- it is not sincere and emotionally invested in the situation
- need to be able to rationally to approach and strategize
- what would the opponent say, whats the debate 
- image yourself as your opponent, to appeal to pathos and ethos
- refuted their argument and develop your own argument, you can agree with some aspect and attack the others
- until you are persuaded
- we are constantly engaging in arguing and persuasion

#### How to develop strategize against pathos
- Cultivate a critical awareness, to defend ourselves from the manipulation

# Modes of Emotional persuasion
#### 1. Satire
- If it is a strong tone, usually pathos
- satire uses irony, ironic contrast and sarcasm
- Depends on the audience, to younger audience they might not understand sarcasm when the language shifts from neutral to objective

- gap between words and reality
- "Ha what a beautiful day today (when its shit outside)"
- dramatic, self irony, contradiction of the world
- can be powerful and emotional tool

	1. "Nice day!"
	2. contrast between what he says and what he means
	3. Actions or words, used mostly in plays
2. **Dramatic**
	- meaning intended by words or actions are opposite and in contrast with the true situation

# Eloquence and "Pathos"
**Eloquence**
- language used powerfully and fluently to appeal to our nobler emotion
- sense of honour, love of country, desire to reach towards virtue

#### Propaganda
- information spread to promote a cause
- exploits people's lack of critical reading thinking and listening
- name calling, glittering generalities, guilt by association, card-stacking
- vague, something that might be true but not important

# Cultivating Pathos
- Alter the emotional appeal by substituting words
- basically put filler words and change your logos into pathos
- structural of a sentence? Passive vs active voices
- changing the agency? whos doing what to who or who is being done by who
- strategy to not tell the truth and manipulate, hiding your intention
