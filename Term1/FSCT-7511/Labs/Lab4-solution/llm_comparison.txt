Comparison of enforce_policy.sh Scripts

Efficiency

Your Script:

Shorter and more compact (~70 lines).

Uses simple loops (e.g., for password aging).

Hardcodes checks/changes (may duplicate PAM entries).

Runs commands broadly (e.g., chmod /home/*).

No modularity, not reusable.

My Script:

Longer (~300+ lines), more verbose.

More idempotent (checks before modifying).

Uses functions for logging and safe execution.

Collects alerts into separate files.

Slightly slower due to more condition checks.

Verdict:

Your script is more efficient in execution speed and simplicity.

My script is more efficient in maintainability and safety.

Readability

Your Script:

Minimal comments (only at section headers).

Contains typos (e.g., /dev/bull).

Inconsistent variable naming.

Easy for a sysadmin to skim quickly.

My Script:

Heavily commented and structured.

Clear separation of tasks (users, groups, auth, files, auditing, SELinux).

Uses helper functions for logging and commands.

Verbose, harder to skim quickly.

Verdict:

Your script is short and direct, but less readable for future maintainers.

My script is well-documented and maintainable, but verbose.

Coverage

Your Script covers:

Home directory permissions.

Password complexity, expiration, reuse prevention.

Lockout policy.

Removes non-admins from sudo/wheel.

File permissions for /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow.

Enables auditd.

SELinux enforcing.

Missing in Your Script:

Unique user accounts check (duplicate UIDs).

Quarterly group membership review.

MFA enforcement.

Sensitive file world-readable check.

Logging of actions with timestamps.

Disabled inactive accounts check.

My Script covers all policy items, including:

Unique UID checks.

Password policies and expiration.

Lockout policy.

sudo/wheel enforcement.

No direct root login.

File permissions and sensitive file scan.

Default umask.

Logging and auditing (auditd, faillog, lastlog).

Disabled inactive accounts.

SELinux enforcing.

Alerts and remediation logs.

Verdict:

Your script = partial coverage (~60%).

My script = full coverage (~100%).

Suggested Improvements

For Your Script:

Add logging with timestamps.

Fix typos (/dev/bull â†’ /dev/null).

Avoid duplicate PAM entries.

Add inactive account check.

Add UID uniqueness check.

Use variables for repeated values.

For My Script:

Reduce verbosity by collapsing checks into functions.

Simplify some loops.

Add interactive remediation prompts.

Modularize into functions like enforce_users(), enforce_groups().
