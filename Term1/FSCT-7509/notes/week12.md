# Live memory
- Encryption, password, artefacts
- bigger the memory, more artefacts
- delete files is not going to be on the RAM 
- recent files, snapshots, files created, encryption keys
- Live forensics stuff 
- get whatever you can while its live
- memory is volatiles, lost and deleted when shutdown and no way to get back that content
- usually is mixed 

# Physical and virtual memory
- physical RAM, RAM Stick
- virtual memory, if not enough physical so create more virtual memory 
- vram on the drive, slower cuz slower read write speed
- memory collection requires both 

# Order of Volatility
- consider the most volatile data, in this case in the RAM
- second is system processes, malware? RDP?
- when pulling the plug, make sure you get everything from the list

# Changes to RAM
- there is no way of not altering the RAM when extracting the RAM
- you will need to know how to explain in court
- notes-taking is important, explain why the RAM is altered 

# Memory Acquisition Tools
- fails pretty often, needs to test them 
- needs to be familiar with them on live device
- practice the tools
- act quick with situations coming with the tools
- Apple devices RAM is not completely purged when shutdown
