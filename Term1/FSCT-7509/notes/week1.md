1. Whats Digital Forensics
	- DF is a branch of the science of forensics
	- Purpose is to find the fingerprints throughtout the internet
	- 1970 first cyber crime, 1990 first widespread computer crime
	- the field of DF only evolved in the last 25 years (obv)
	- Crypto currency is the new thing around 2000
		- unregulated 
		- untraceable

	- Find the defintion of Forensics Science in the slides
		- 
	
	- Metadata
		- who created, when, conduct report and presented 
	
	- Anything we do is related to an investigation
		- Regardless of our position
		- We find clues and evidence to solve a crime, which can be connected with legal actions

	- Summary: Preservation, Identification, Extraction, Interpretation, Documentation of computer evidence

2. Objective of Digital Forensics
	- find out what happened
	- collect and analyze
	- present data

	- What data was affected?
	- What files were stolen?
	- Was there an attack, virus?
	- Who used the device at a specific time/date?
	- Where was the device at a specific time?

	- Goal is to gather information, understand the situation to know how and when it happened
	- When collecting data we adhere to standard process
	- The information are collected and analyze to present to legal officers
	- Often times we do not have to attend court testimony

3. Day in the life of DF examiner
	- Labs and field
		- in field we work with others
		- execute search warrants for fedral and private organizations
		- First to be on-site
			- Law enforcemnet like: Police, CRA, CBSA
			- Any otherr feral agency like SIS, FBI, CIA

		- Types of cases on federal level:
			- Financial Fraud
			- Drug/Weapons dealers
			- Cyber Bullying
			- Distribution of CP
			- Murder cases
			- Terror organizations
			- Falsifying documents

		- Types of cases on corporate level:
			- Corporate mischief
			- Defamation
			- Disgruntled employees steals/sell information to competitors
			- Data theft

		- Types of cases in the private sector
			- Corporate mischief
			- Defamation
			- Spousal infidelity
			- Partners dispute

 		- Digital Forensics Investigators
			- Specialized trained in Digital forensic investigation

		- Day of life of a DF Investigator
			- The places we go are usually messy, everything out of place
			- We are to find and investigate in these environments
			- Identify and Secure the scene
				- Faraday bags are often used so signals from outside is blocked
			
3. Investigation Process
		- Step 1 - Identification
			- Removable media (floppies, CDs, USB drives)
			- Cellular Phones and Smart Phones
			- Small device docking units and chargers
			- USB Storage devices (external harddrives, keychains, smart watches)
			- Memory cards (SD cards, micro SDs)
			- Digital Camera, Printers (as long as there is a hard drive in it)
			- Modems, routers (Logging files)
		
		- Step 2 - Data Preservation - Live vs Dead Devices
			- Live device 
				- Memory
				- Browser History Data, event data
				- Cloud data ("Avalialbe data")
			- Dead device
				- pop the hood, get the disk get the data
			
			- Encryption
				- Apple machines are the most secure machines and encrypted (we currently do not have technology to unlock apple pcs)
					* you cannot testify yourself according to Canadian Chapter 8

			- Tools for perserving the Evidence
				- Clone or Image the digital media
				- Onsite imaging vs Seizing the drive
				- Different tools and approaches
				- Risk of contamination

		- Step 3 - Analyzing the evidence
			- File Recovery: Deleted and partially overwritten
			- Keyword Searching 
			- Registry Analysis
			- Specific Analysis:
				- Web activity report
				- Malware analysis
				- Evidence of spoliation
				- Improper access
				- Time stomping

		- Step 4 - Reporting and Presenting
			- Multiple ways to report:
				- Full Forensics reporte outlining analysis, methodology, key findings, data integrity
				- Data

			- Evidence Handling
				- Maintain Chain Of Custody
				- Ensure the legitimacy of the evidence presented in court is unquestionable
				- Meaning that the evidence remains untouched as in the state of obtained
